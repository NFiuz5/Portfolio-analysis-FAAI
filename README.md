# Portfolio-analysis-FAAI

This is a very roughly coded script that allows the user to analyse its portfolio and especially its reward/risks ratio (Sharpe ratio with interest rate equals to 0)

It also give on the second sheet the optimized weights for the given portfolio in order to maximize its reward/risks ratio

In order to use it you should download the whole repository and modify the w_p (weighted portfolio) in the Portfolio.py file, after that just run the python file and you will get an excel sheet with the results of the analysis.
